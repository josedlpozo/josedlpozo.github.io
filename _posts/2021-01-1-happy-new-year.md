title: Happy New Year

Hi everyone!

It's been a long time since the last time I wrote a post on the blog. Tough year this one, this virus has changed our lives in a way that was impossible to predict one year ago. Last year I didn't think on any goals to achieve, and for sure, if I have done it, I wouldn't have achieved them.

In this post I would like to recap the year because although it was challenging many things changed for the good. 

## Q1



## What now?

Maybe you are wondering, what now? Here it is, now it is closer to his Android big brother version. We prioritize the features that our users use the most:

* Save route
* Share route

This is still a small taste of what **Just Draw It** could be, but we are in the path to build an awesome iOS app.

To finish this post we would like to talk about the damn COVID-19 in our country. These days are being tough for all of us. Spain is suffering one of the worst scenarios of our history and we would like to say thank you to all the doctors/nurses and people working hard to overcome this. Together we win.
