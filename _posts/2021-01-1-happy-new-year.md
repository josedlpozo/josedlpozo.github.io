Hi everyone!

It's been a long time since the last time I wrote a post on the blog. Tough year this one, this virus has changed our lives in a way that was impossible to predict one year ago. Last year I didn't think on any goals to achieve, and for sure, if I have done it, I wouldn't have achieved them.

In this post I would like to recap the year because although it was challenging many things changed for the good. 

## Just Draw It iOS

In February we started the [iOS version of Just Draw It](/2020/03/15/just-draw-it-ios.html) and was live at the end of the month. We tried to keep it simple from the beginning but nowadays both apps have the same features ðŸŽ‰.

It had more than 15k downloads during 2020, which is not as impressive as Android that had more than 180k, but it is a very good number. The goal for this 2021 on Just Draw It iOS is getting more than **50k downloads**.

## Just Draw It

We thought that the lock down and restrictions around the world would make Just Draw It to decrease, but out of the blue this year has been a success for Just Draw It!

We appeared on [Xataka Android](https://www.xatakandroid.com/aplicaciones-android/como-medir-distancias-google-maps-facilmente-esta-app-para-android-just-draw-it) and [Microsiervos](https://www.microsiervos.com/archivo/mundoreal/just-draw-it.html), two spanish blogs that enforces us during the quarantine and its impacted was huge.

The goal for this 2021 on Just Draw It is continue with this tendency, we will work harder to build the best features for our users.

## Area

Just Draw It was created with the goal of learning new Android architectures and how to deal with maps. We didn't know at the beginning if the product would be use by users, so we did the code as flexible as possible.

This flexibility allowed us to create a simple but useful app reusing most of the Just Draw It code. We had [Area](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lapacadevs.area) and [Area iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/area-fields-area-finder/id1534601879) ready in a couple of weeks.

The goal for 2021 on Area is to continue growing, improving and adding more and more features.

It has been one the worst year possible, but it has passed and now its our turn to fight on this 2021.

Happy New Year!
