title: Monetize your ads!
---

Hi everyone!

This time I would like to share with you our experience with ads in Just Draw It. We decided to start monetizing using ads because its easy setup and we already have experience with them. We didn't know that it wouldn't be a easy task.

## Beginning

There are two main types of ads. *Intersticial* is a full screen ad and *Banner* is a small size ad that is rendered in the screen. Of course, they don't monetize the same, *Intersticial* ones gives better rewards.

So, we decided to show an *Intersticial* ad when our users open a saved route. Everything was setup as we expected, but after one month Google stopped serving us ads ðŸ˜­. We didn't know if it was our problem or theirs, but we haven't changed our code, so... it must be Google.

This issue was fixed after a month, but it continued to go up and down after some weeks. Hopefully, this is not happening any more ðŸ¥³

By the way, our implementation of ads monetize was using just one *Intersticial* when a user opens its already saved route and it was going good. This approach gave us a regular income each month, but as we were growing in users, we should be growing in income from ads. This didn't happen.

## Investigation

We have almost everything user interaction track in our analytics service provider, so we investigated the actions that a free user does the most. These actions would give us most impressions in Google ads, so which were these actions?

* Click undo
* Click close
* Click save

These actions are sorted by its usage. We discard save action because we already show an ad in **save** flow. Between undo and close, although undo has more usage than close we thought it wasn't a good choice. Undo is an action that the user needs to *undo* the last segment and usually they click on it several times in a short period of time. It wouldn't be a good experiencie if we show an ad on each click.

So, we decided to show an *Intersticial* every time our users click on **close**. This was risky because we didn't want bad reviews or a decrease in our downloads, so this was just an experiment. And... it works! We didn't receive any bad feedback/review, the downloads went normal and.. the most important, our ads income grew!

Here it's a chart about our ads income. As you can see, in July and September Google stopped serving us ads. After September, everything started to go normal until our change in February that our income grew by **80%**!

Let's take risk!
