Hi to all of you!

It's been a long time since my last post. I tried to write about code in a blog twice and I failed. **Why do I fail writing about my passion?** It requires a lot of time finding a topic, investigating it and finally, write a good blog post. Too much effort.

## Pet project

This past year I started with my uncle a pet project that we have been working on since April. We had a problem when going out for a walk and we wanted to walk an exact number of kilometers. We looked for apps that fulfill our requirements, but we didn't find anyone. I know, probably all of you are thinking on Google Maps but it doesn't have this feature exactly.

In Google Maps you can create a route and add waypoints between the starting and finishing point, this is pretty similar to our idea was but it doesn't allow you to measure the distance between waypoints before adding them. We wanted to have this information in realtime and not adding a waypoint and then check if it suits your necessity.

## Just Draw It

This was the very first start of [Just Draw It by Lapacadevs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lapacadevs.justdrawit). We spent two weeks in the first version of the app, an Android application that the main (and only) feature was to draw with your finger on a map and render the distance of the route while the user is drawing. After this initial release, we were adding small features almost every week.

This is how the application looks like now

Why do I start talking about this? Because writing about code, as I said, is too much effort and I don't enjoy it as much as I thought. This past year working on Just Draw It has been amazing because it doesn't involve just code but product and strategy. This is the topic I would like to move this blog, writing about product, about the decisions we take in Just Draw It and how those decisions affect.

Just Draw It has more than 50k downloads in Google Play Store and 4.5 of rating, we are very proud of it. We have taken some good decisions and more bad decisions, but we enjoy the path!

Stay tuned, this project is just starting and we wanna share this with you!
